# Unity-MVVM
Simple, Lightweight MVVM Framework for Unity3D

For a background on MVVM checkout the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

The goal of this project is to implement some of the concepts I knew and loved from developing WPF applications, mainly that they be very quick to build, and easy to maintain. It also attempts to solve some of the Unity-specific pain points I've uncovered over the last few years working with Unity.

## Add to a project
This project now supports Unity's package manager! The easiest way to get Unity-MVVM + Samples and keep it up to date is to add it in the package manager window.

 Click the + icon at the top left and select "Add from git url." Then copy+paste the https url from this repo and make sure to add the #upm to get the right branch: https://github.com/push-pop/Unity-MVVM.git#upm

The library will be automatically added to your project, and you can download samples from the package manager to see demonstrated usage.

# Contributing

I am open to contributions, requests, PRs etc... however know that this is mostly a personal project for my own use in my [production projects](https://nateturley.com/), so I can't guarantee I will accept a change.
